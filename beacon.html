         <div class="grid-item item1"><h4>Intro</h4><p>Beacon Mountain, locally Mount Beacon, is the highest peak of Hudson Highlands, located behind the City of Beacon, New York, in the Town of Fishkill. Its two summits rise above the Hudson River behind the city and can easily be seen from Newburgh across the river and many other places in the region. The more accessible northern peak, at 1,531 feet (467 m) above sea level, has a complex of radio antennas on its summit; the 1,610-foot (491 m) southern summit has a fire lookout tower.</p><p>Beacon Reservoir, the city's main water source, is located between North Beacon and neighboring Scofield Ridge, the highest peak in Putnam County. Since much of the land on the mountains and up to the county line is owned by the city to protect the watershed, an extensive system of roads and trails makes it a popular hiking area. Both summits afford extensive views of the mid-Hudson region, and on clear days New York City is visible from the fire tower.</p></div>

         <div class="grid-item item7"><h4>Tips and Tricks</h4> <p>The High Peaks' mountains are no easy task, and definetly are not meant for beginners. It is reccomended you tackle these mountains with some experience from prior hikes. Make sure to have enough equipment to last you a night. Weather changes very rapidly at high altitudes so it is reccomended you prepare for any and every kind of weather. If hiking these peaks in the winter, it is highly reccomended you wear snow shoes and/or spikes, as you would not get far without them. Also make sure to have a map as the trail markers could easily get covered up by the heavy amounts of snow that falls at these altitudes</p></div>
