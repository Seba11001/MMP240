         <div class="grid-item item1"><h4>Intro</h4><p>Slide Mountain is the highest peak in the Catskill Mountains of the U.S. state of New York. It is located in the town of Shandaken in Ulster County. While the 4,180-foot (1,270 m) contour line on topographic maps is generally accepted as its height, the exact elevation of the summit has never been officially determined by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and many informal surveys suggest the mountain may actually top 4,200 feet (1,280 m) above sea level.</p><p>While it was not identified as the range's highest peak until the late 19th century, it has played a prominent role in Catskill history. Renowned naturalist John Burroughs wrote memorably of his climbs up Slide, and it helped get the Catskills added to New York's Forest Preserve. Bicknell's thrush was first identified on its summit. Like most other Catskill peaks, Slide's summit is gentle and rounded, taking the form of a narrow ridge that rises to a wider bump on its eastern end. From there the mountain slopes down steeply to the col with neighboring Cornell Mountain.</p></div>

         <div class="grid-item item7"><h4>Tips and Tricks</h4> <p>While these mountains may not seem as intimidating as the High Peaks, some of them are still fairly difficult and a task to to tackle. Make sure to have proper footwear as the trails could range from dry and rough rocks to wet mud. Be sure to know which trail to go on as there are hundreds of different routes criss-crosssing the mountain range. If hiking in the winter, micro-spikes are reccomended as under the snow there is frequently a layer of thick ice that might make it difficult to traverse without grip.</p></div>
