<h1>The Parks of NYC</h1>
    
    <p>A great place to admire the cities' night-time lights is from one of the most wild places in New York. Central Park. This little slice of the wilderness located smack-dab in the middle of Manhattan hosts some of the most wonderful views of the city. The contrast between the trees and wilderness of the park and the stark, bright lights of the city really bring out the beauty of New York</p>
