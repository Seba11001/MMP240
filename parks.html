<h2>The Parks of NYC</h2>
     <div class="grid-container">
         <div class="grid-item item1"><h4>Intro</h4><p>A great place to admire the cities' night-time lights is from one of the most wild places in New York. Central Park. This little slice of the wilderness located smack-dab in the middle of Manhattan hosts some of the most wonderful views of the city. The contrast between the trees and wilderness of the park and the stark, bright lights of the city really bring out the beauty of New York</p></div>

         <div class="grid-item item3"><h4>Why Parks?</h4><p>When someone thinks of New York City, parks aren't the first things that usually come to mind. People usually think of the skyscrapers, the subway, Times Square, all elements of urban New York. However there are definetly some less urbanized parts of the city that tourists and locals can both enjoy. These provide a little slice of nature in the city but still somehow make it feel unique to New York. That's what makes this city so special.</p></div>
     <div class="grid-item item5"><h4>Central Park</h4>
    <p>A definite go-to as far as New York City parks go, Central Park is world-renowned for its beuaty and stark contrast between the the city and what could be a whole wilderness. While most people like to enjoy Central Park during the day, it can also be very beautiful and even some may say magical in the night. The lights in Central Park give just enough to be able to see where you're going, but not so bright as to feel completeley unnatural. It is also a great way to see the lights coming from upper midtown skyscraper since the dark contrast of the trees matches well with the brightness of those lights. A definite must see! </p>
