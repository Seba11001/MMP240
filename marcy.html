         <div class="grid-item item1"><h4>Intro</h4><p>Mount Marcy (Mohawk: Tewawe’éstha[3]) is the highest point in New York State,[4] with an elevation of 5,343 feet (1,629 m).[1] and an isolation of 130 mile. It is located in the Town of Keene in Essex County. The mountain is in the heart of the Adirondack High Peaks Region of the High Peaks Wilderness Area. Its stature and expansive views make it a popular destination for hikers, who crowd its summit in the summer months.</p><p>Lake Tear of the Clouds, at the col between Mt. Marcy and Mt. Skylight, is often cited as the highest source of the Hudson River,[5] via Feldspar Brook and the Opalescent River, even though the main stem of the Opalescent River has as its source a higher point two miles north of Lake of the Clouds, and that stem is a mile longer than Feldspar Brook. Mount Marcy is one of the High Peaks of the Adirondack Mountains. The majority of the mountain is forested, although the final few hundred feet is above the tree line. The peak is dominated by rocky outcrops, lichens, and alpine shrubs. There are two plaques at the top commemorating the centennial of the climb as well as the mountain summit itself.</p></div>

         <div class="grid-item item7"><h4>Tips and Tricks</h4> <p>The High Peaks' mountains are no easy task, and definetly are not meant for beginners. It is reccomended you tackle these mountains with some experience from prior hikes. Make sure to have enough equipment to last you a night. Weather changes very rapidly at high altitudes so it is reccomended you prepare for any and every kind of weather. If hiking these peaks in the winter, it is highly reccomended you wear snow shoes and/or spikes, as you would not get far without them. Also make sure to have a map as the trail markers could easily get covered up by the heavy amounts of snow that falls at these altitudes</p></div>
