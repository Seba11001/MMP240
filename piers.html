<h2>The Piers of NYC</h2>
    <div class="grid-container">

        <div class="grid-item item1"><h4>Intro</h4> <p>New York City, being the largest city in the United States, understandably has many places to visit. From the cluttered streets to Midtown Manhattan to the much less crowded shores of the Brooklyn piers, New York has many places to admire its views. There is a fit for just about everyone from everywhere.</p></div>

        <div class="grid-item item3"><h4>Why Piers?</h4><p>One of the best places to enjoy the cities' views is one of the many piers located around the city. Dating back to New York's industrial days where goods would be transported from the city all over the world. Today, many of these piers have been transfromed into parks for anyone, from NYC natives to tourists, could enjoy. The reason piers provide such stunning views of the city is because naturally, nothing obscures your view from the cities' sites. You can really get a sense of how massive the city is from looking at it from a pier. </p></div>
    
     <div class="grid-item item5"><h4>The Williamsburg Pier</h4>
         <p>The Williambsurg pier, located in Brooklin along the East River, is one of the best places to admire the city nights. You can see nearly all of Manhattan. From the Freedom Tower in downtown, to the tall but skinny 432 Park Avenue apartment building. It is truely a stunning sight the first time you experience it. So fascinating how far humanity has come from using fires to light the night to using electricity to light up whole cities. Overall, this pier is a great place to admire the city, take pictures, or even relax and unwind. It's a must visit!</p></div>
