    <h1>Introdcution</h1>
    <p>The first thing you’ll probably notice is the lights, as we are primarily a visual species. If 
you look around at midtown Manhattan at 10pm the amount of artificial lighting might shock 
you. Lights turned on from office buildings, street lamps, cars driving by. To an outsider it might even be overwhelming but to a New Yorker it’s just another day in the city. If one were transported from 500 B.C Athens, they would be astounded at the progress of human innovation to the point of calling the lights works of the Gods. But to a New Yorker, it’s barely noticeable.The lights make it almost look like day, which makes the term “the city that never sleeps” make sense. </p>
